  <p>While I was setting up this blog recently, I had to clone a repo
to get a copy of the theme that I wanted to use. When I did so,
I was shocked to find the download took a couple of minutes and
had over 73 MB of files.</p>
<p>Not sure what, in a CSS dependency, could take up so much space,
I started digging through the disk usage, and found this damning
report:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">‚ùØ du -h -d <span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span> .
4.0K	./test
508K	./css
 72M	./docs
 20K	./.github
260K	./sass
 73M	.
</code></pre></div><p>Literally, more than 98% of the size of the repo was consumed by
the docs.</p>
<p>Now in this specific case, the majority of that space was consumed
by images for the documentation. Binary files in git are already
a bit of an issue (particulary if they are updated with any frequency),
but this leads me to question: are docs on the same branch as code
an antipattern?</p>
<p>If the docs were separated onto a different branch, the repo could be
cloned (including this specific case of a submodule included in a
different repo) sparsely such that these files could not need to be
included.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>recent experience cloning a repo</p>
<ul>
<li>show du of the repo root</li>
<li>breakdown by % for docs</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>realize that changes to docs will persist in the git history FOREVER</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why did anyone think this was a good idea?</p>
<ul>
<li>acknowledge that it is easier to understand</li>
<li>older versions of git made it harder</li>
<li>the docs are right there on github without digging around for the doc branch</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Generated resources (generally)</p>
