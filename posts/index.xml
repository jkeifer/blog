            <description>Introduction Hello. I am a software engineer from Portland hoping to spread some knowledge when I have something possibly interesting to share.
This is a new thing for me, technical blogging, so it might take me a little time to get started, but I hope I can start to churn out a regular stream of meaningful content quickly.
So please, stay tuned.</description>
