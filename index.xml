      <description>Introduction I do a lot of work with network devices, which are often headless and require the use of serial consoles for out-of-band access. My go-to on MacOS and Linux has been screen, but various little issues over the years have led me to consider other options. I tried minicom on the recommendation of a colleague, but that didn&amp;rsquo;t work for me either.
I&amp;rsquo;ve struggled to pinpoint my problem with the aforementioned tools; I think I just want something less featurful, something that literally only gives me a tty via serial and doesn&amp;rsquo;t have anything unnecessary between my terminal and the remote shell.</description>

      <description>As I mentioned in my first post, much of my resistance to blogging has been a blend of prefectionism and an abhorrence to any chance of having to deal with yet more infrastructure issue. That is, I deal with broken crap at my day job; I really don&amp;rsquo;t want to have to worry about that for my blog. In that vein, I pursued the simplest practical stack with the quickest startup time, ending up with a static site generated with Hugo hosted as a GitHub page.</description>

      <description>Hello. I am a software engineer from Portland hoping to spread some knowledge when I have something possibly interesting to share.
This is a new thing for me, technical blogging, so it might take me a little time to get started, but I hope I can start to churn out a regular stream of meaningful content quickly.
Why do this? I have increasingly been feeling the pressure to start a technical blog.</description>
