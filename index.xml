      <description>As I mentioned in my first post, much of my resistance to blogging has been a blend of prefectionism and an abhorrence to any chance of having to deal with yet more infrastructure issue. That is, I deal with broken crap at my day job; I really don&amp;rsquo;t want to have to worry about that for my blog. In that vein, I pursued the simplest practical stack with the quickest startup time, ending up with a static site generated with Hugo hosted as a GitHub page.</description>

      <description>Hello. I am a software engineer from Portland hoping to spread some knowledge when I have something possibly interesting to share.
This is a new thing for me, technical blogging, so it might take me a little time to get started, but I hope I can start to churn out a regular stream of meaningful content quickly.
Why do this? I have increasingly been feeling the pressure to start a technical blog.</description>
