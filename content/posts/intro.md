Hello. I am a software engineer from Portland hoping to spread
some knowledge when I have something possibly interesting to share.

This is a new thing for me, technical blogging, so it might take me
a little time to get started, but I hope I can start to churn out a
regular stream of meaningful content quickly.

So please, stay tuned.
